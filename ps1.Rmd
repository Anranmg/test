## Question 1
### Part A
```{sh,echo=FALSE}
# !/bin/bash
#part a
# How many rows are there for region 3 in the RECS 2015 data set?
cat recs2015_public_v3.csv | awk -F, '{print $2}'| grep 3 | wc -l
#method2
cat recs2015_public_v3.csv | cut -d "," -f 2 | grep 3 | wc -l

#data set containing only: DOEID, NWEIGHT, and BRRWT1-BRRWT96.
cut -d "," -f 1,475-571 recs2015_public_v3.csv> subset.csv
```

### Part B
```{sh,echo=FALSE}
#part 2
#loop to count and print number of observations within each region.
for d in 1 2 3 4
do
 echo $d
 cut -d "," -f 2 recs2015_public_v3.csv | grep $d | wc -l
done

#file region_division.txt (sorted list unique combi REGIONC,DIVISION
cut -d "," -f 2-3 recs2015_public_v3.csv| sort | uniq -d -u> region_division.txt
```

## Question 2
###Question 2 a.
Which airlines were responsible for at least 1% of the flights

```{r q2a, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
source('ps1_q2.R')
kable(select(al_1pct_13,name,pct13), digits=2, 
      col.names=c("airline","pecent(%)"),caption='Proprtion of Flights by Airlines Over 1%.')
```


###Question 2 b.
number and percent of annual flights in the first 10 months of 2013 and the first 10 months of 2014: 

```{r q2b, echo=FALSE}
kable(select(al_1pct_13_14,name,num13,prop13,lwr13,upr13), digits=2, 
      col.names = c("Airline","Number","Pecent(%)","Lower bound(%)","Upper bound(%)"),
      caption='Number and Percent of Annual Flights (%) in First 10 Months, 2013.')  
kable(select(al_1pct_13_14,name,num14,prop14,lwr14,upr14), digits=2, 
      col.names = c("Airline","Number","Pecent(%)","Lower bound(%)","Upper bound(%)"),
      caption='Number and Percent of Annual Flights (%) in First 10 Months, 2014.')  
kable(select(al_1pct_13_14,name,change,lwr_change, upr_change), digits=2, 
      col.names = c("Airline","Pecent Change(%)","Lower bound(%)","Upper bound(%)"),
      caption='Percent Change of Annual Flights (%) in First 10 Months, 2013-2014.')  

```

Which airlines showed the largest increase and decrease?

largest increase: Delta Air Lines Inc.
largest decrease: Endeavor Air Inc.

Why do some airlines show an increase in the percent of flights but a decrease in the number of flights?

It is due to change in the total yearly amount of flights. As total number of flights in
2014 declined from 279384 to 251809, percent would rise with drop in number for airlines.   


###Question 2 c.
Among of the three NYC airports
```{r q2c, echo=FALSE}
kable(select(al_pct,origin,name,pct), digits=2, 
      col.names = c("Airport","Airline","Pecent(%)"),
      caption='Proprtion of Flights (%) by Airlines at Each NYC Airports.')
kable(al_pct_pa, digits=2, 
      col.names = c("Airport","Airline","Pecent(%)","Lower bound(%)","Upper bound(%)"),
      caption='Proprtion of Flights (%) by Airlines in Part A.')
```

Which airline is the largest carrier at each airport?

```{r q2c-largest, echo=FALSE}
kable(al_pct_max, digits=2, 
      col.names = c("Airport","Airline","Pecent(%)"),
      caption='Largest Carrier at Each Airport.')
```

##Question3
###Question 3 a
```{r question3,echo=FALSE}
source('ps1_q3.R')
#produce a table-----------------------------------------------------
knitr::kable(pct_stucco, digits=2, 
             col.names = c("Division","Pecent(%)","Std_error","Lower bound(%)","Upper bound(%)"),
             caption='Percent of Homes in Stucco Construction within Each Division.')

#produce a scatter plot-----------------------------------------------------
ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=pct_stucco,aes(x=factor(DIVISION),y=pct))+
  #geom_errorbar(data=pct_stucco,
  #             aes(x=factor(DIVISION),pct,ymin=lwr,ymax=upr),
  #            color="red",width=0.2)+
  labs(x="Division",y="Percent",
       title = "Scatter Plot of Stucco Percent within Each Division")
```

Which division has the highest proportion? Which the lowest?

highest proportion: division 9, 
lowest proportion: divison 6

###Question 3 b
Average total electricity usage in kilowatt hours in each division
```{r q3b1,echo=FALSE}
#produce a table-----------------------------------------------------
knitr::kable(avg_e, digits=2, 
              col.names = c("Division","Average","Std_error","Lower bound","Upper bound"),
             caption='Average Total Electricity Usage within Each Division.')
```

```{r q3b2,echo=FALSE}
#produce a table-----------------------------------------------------
knitr::kable(avg_e_type, digits=2, 
             col.names = c("Division","Type","Average","Std_error","Lower bound","Upper bound"),
             caption='Average Total Electricity Usage (Urban/Rural) within Each Division.')

#produce a plot-----------------------------------------------------
ggplot(data=avg_e_type, aes(x=factor(DIVISION), y=avg_elec, fill=TYPE)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", color="black", position=position_dodge())+
  theme_minimal() + scale_fill_manual(values=c('#999999','#E69F00'))+
  labs(x="Division",y="Average",
       title = "Average Total Electricity Usage within Each Division")
```

###Question 3 c
```{r q3c,echo=FALSE}
#produce a table-----------------------------------------------------
knitr::kable(prop_inte_diff, digits=2, 
             col.names = c("Division","Prop. Disparity(%)","Std_error","Lower bound(%)","Upper bound(%)"),
             caption='Proportion of Homes with Internet Access within Each Division.')
```

Which division has the largest disparity between urban and rural areas in terms of the proportion of homes with internet access?

division 9
